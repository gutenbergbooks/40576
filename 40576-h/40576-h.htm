<span class="smcap">A robin</span> came one day in spring,<br />
From South he flew with tired wing;<br />
He looked around him then to see<br />
An old familiar cherry-tree.<br />
<br />
There grew one by the kitchen door,<br />
Redbreast had seen that one before;<br />
He flew about, then lit up high,<br />
And watched to see some one pass by.<br />
<br />
A girl came through the kitchen door,<br />
Her years, I think, just numbered four;<br />
She saw Redbreast, and called to him,<br />
As he perched upon that cherry limb:&mdash;<br />
<br />
"Oh, sweet robin! When did you come?<br />
Are you hungry? Do you want a crumb?<br />
Are you thirsty? Do you want a drink?<br />
You must be very tired, I think.<br />
<br />
"Say, Sir Robin, why don't you sing?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span><br />
Or don't you know that this is spring?<br />
Where have you been this winter long?<br />
I missed, so much, your little song!"<br />
<br />
"I flew about in a sunny clime,<br />
Singing my 'cheer-up!' most the time.<br />
And what did you, my little maid,<br />
While I down South this winter stayed?"<br />
<br />
"When Christmas came we had a tree,<br />
And that was nice for Lisle and me;<br />
'Twas hung so full of things all new,<br />
I wish that you had seen it too.<br />
<br />
"I got some blocks and he a drum,<br />
I tell you then we had some fun!<br />
We got some dolls and whistles too,<br />
And then we played, and then we blew.<br />
<br />
"We got a sled and went to slide;<br />
We went to town and had a ride;<br />
We popped some corn when days were cold,<br />
And ate as much as we could hold.<br />
<br />
"One doll got sick and had the croup,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><br />
Another coughed with dreadful whoop;<br />
And so, Redbreast, I think you'll see<br />
I've been as busy as I could be.<br />
<br />
"And now, Redbreast, where is your mate?<br />
What made her stay down South so late?<br />
Why don't she come to build her nest,<br />
And lay some eggs, and sit and rest?"<br />
<br />
"Oh, she'll come soon, and then you'll see<br />
We'll build right here in this same tree,<br />
And here we'll stay till cherries are gone,<br />
And then sing you a parting song."</td></tr></table>

<tr><td>
<span class="smcap">You</span> may talk about old Santa Claus,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With his sleigh and fleeting deer;</span><br />
You may tell about his furry coat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the jingling bells you hear.</span><br />
<br />
You may talk about the Christmas trees<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which he loads with lots of toys;</span><br />
You may tell about the dolls and sleds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That he brings for girls and boys.</span><br />
<br />
You may picture him in story-books.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a beard that's long and white;</span><br />
You may paint him when he's going down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through the chimneys in the night.</span><br />
<br />
You may tell the story o'er and o'er<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just the way 'twas told to you;</span><br />
And I've listened to it often,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I've learned it isn't true.</span><br />
<br />
You may write about his pretty deer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As they climb upon the roofs,</span><br />
But it's very plain to any one<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That they can't climb up with hoofs.</span><br />
<br />
And I know that Santa never went<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down a chimney in the night,</span><br />
For they all are dark and small around,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they'd squeeze him awful tight.</span><br />
<br />
If he ever did get into one,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then he never could get out,</span><br />
For they picture him in story-books<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a form that's broad and stout.</span><br />
<br />
Then he can't come through the outside doors,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the bolts and locks are there;</span><br />
Nor he can't get through the cellar door<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To climb the cellar stair.</span><br />
<br />
Nor he never could get over all<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This whole world in a night,</span><br />
To fill the little stockings up,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And get home before it's light.</span><br />
<br />
Then no one ever seems to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the dear old fellow dwells;</span><br />
And no-one ever saw his sleigh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor heard his jingling bells.</span><br />
<br />
I've looked the maps all through and through,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But his home I cannot find;</span><br />
So at last I've concluded this:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That he's only "in your mind."</span><br />
<br />
And this pretty little tale you tell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the babies may be told;</span><br />
But 'twill hardly do for me to hear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For I've grown too big and old.</span></td></tr></table>

<span class="smcap">I like</span> to see a handsome boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With good and honest face;</span><br />
The one who has a twinkling eye<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And form of manly grace.</span><br />
<br />
I like to see him go to school,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And like to see him play;</span><br />
But much, I fear, of what he does<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is time just thrown away.</span><br />
<br />
I much admire the little man<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who brings the coal and wood;</span><br />
And helps his mama when she's tired,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As every good boy should.</span><br />
<br />
I like the boy who never steals<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pie upon the shelf;</span><br />
And never hunts the cookies up<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To eat them all himself.</span><br />
<br />
I like the boy who heeds advice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And does as he should do;</span><br />
And so I like the thoughtful lad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who's good to sister too.</span><br />
<br />
And thus you see my views are plain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when I older grow</span><br />
I sometimes think&mdash;I guess&mdash;may be&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I&mdash;shall have&mdash;a beau.</span><br />
<br />
But he must be the model lad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who does not chew nor swear;</span><br />
And he must be a temperance boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who goes not on a tear.</span><br />
<br />
He must not speak of parents dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Regardless of respect;</span><br />
He must not call them fogies old,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor their advice reject.</span><br />
<br />
And so the one that I will take,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And love him as a brother,</span><br />
Will be the good, old-fashioned boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who always minds his mother.</span></td></tr></table>

<span class="smcap">I'd like</span> to see old Santa Claus<br />
And find out who he really was.<br />
<br />
I think 'twould be a pretty sight<br />
To see him coming in the night.<br />
<br />
And watch him on the housetops ride,<br />
Then see him down the chimneys glide.<br />
<br />
I think it's very, very queer<br />
The way he comes round every year.<br />
<br />
For no one ever sees or knows<br />
Just how he comes or how he goes.<br />
<br />
And how he can so quiet be,<br />
Is the very strangest part to me.<br />
<br />
But Christmas morn, in early dawn,<br />
We're sure to find he's come and gone;<br />
<br />
For there upon our Christmas tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span><br />
Are toys for brothers and for me.<br />
<br />
But not a mark, or not a track,<br />
Does he ever leave when going back.<br />
<br />
And so I've wondered many a time<br />
How Santa could the chimney climb.<br />
<br />
I think 'twould be a better way<br />
To travel round by light of day;<br />
<br />
Than go a-prowling round at night<br />
Like burglars do, to keep from sight.<br />
<br />
Then little children all could see<br />
Who their good Santa Claus might be.<br />
<br />
And then we'd know, without being told,<br />
If Santa Claus was young or old.<br />
<br />
If he was fat, or very thin,<br />
If he had whiskers on his chin.<br />
<br />
If he was short or very tall&mdash;<br />
Why, girls like us would know it all.<br />
<br />
Then how much nicer it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span><br />
For him to come when we could see,<br />
<br />
Than always come when we're asleep,<br />
So none of us at him can peep.<br />
<br />
I think I'll write him just a line<br />
And say: "Please come some other time;<br />
<br />
"For I don't think it looks just right<br />
For you to always come at night."</td></tr></table>

<br />
I'll tell him to look in the corner,<br />

<span class="smcap">A sparrow</span> flew to my window one day,<br />
And in a bird's way he began there to say:<br />
"Chirp, chirp, little girl, please listen to me<br />
I'm hungry and cold as a sparrow can be!<br />
<br />
"I'd like a small crumb or something to eat,<br />
And may I come in and warm my poor feet?<br />
They're almost frozen out here in the snow;<br />
So kind little girl, please do not say no."<br />
<br />
I listened to him and then shook my head;<br />
And to that poor sparrow I saucily said:<br />
"Well, Mr. Sparrow, if your story is true,<br />
I don't think I'll trouble myself about you.<br />
<br />
"You're a plain-looking bird with a dirty old coat,<br />
And you never once sang a sweet little note<br />
So, Mr. Sparrow, you may just fly along,<br />
For I feed none but birds of beauty and song."<br />
<br />
"But think, little girl, were you a bird like me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span><br />
And were out in the cold with your home in a tree,<br />
And you came to my house in the cold, deep snow,<br />
Would you think it were kind if I treated you so?<br />
<br />
"Would you think it quite right to be twitted that way,<br />
Just because of your coat was not handsome and gay?<br />
Would you think it would be nice if you could not sing<br />
To be counted as naught but a poor useless thing?<br />
<br />
"I know I'm not handsome, and my chirp is not sweet,<br />
I know I'm not loved by the most that I meet;<br />
But I'm just as God made me, a plain little bird,<br />
And have, in this world, a right to be heard.<br />
<br />
"And the birds of great beauty you like to see,<br />
In the sight of our Maker are no better than me.<br />
So I bid you adieu, my proud little miss,<br />
But some time I pray you will just think of this:<br />
<br />
"That kind little deeds by a good little child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span><br />
So often will tame a nature that's wild.<br />
Then always be kind and never be rude,<br />
And hold to your tongue in an angry mood."<br />
<br />
Then he nodded his head and flew far away,<br />
And I saw him no more that cold winter day.<br />
But, oh! how sorry and grieved was I then,<br />
When I saw how very unkind I had been.<br />
<br />
He was only a sparrow, so humble and plain,<br />
But the lesson he taught me will always remain.<br />
As I journey through life I shall keep it in mind,<br />
And never again will I act so unkind.</td></tr></table>

<span class="smcap">They</span> were gazing through the window,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On a cold December day,</span><br />
At the pretty toys for children,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That were shown in fine array.</span><br />
<br />
One was robed in richest raiment,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a face so bright and glad;</span><br />
One was dressed in poorest garments,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a face so wan and sad.</span><br />
<br />
While they gazed upon the window,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said the rich one to the poor:</span><br />
"Ain't it nice that Christmas is coming,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For that brings old Santa sure.</span><br />
<br />
"Oh! he's going to bring a dolly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a lovely Christmas tree,</span><br />
And some toys and nuts and candy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And some story-books for me.</span><br />
<br />
"Don't you know what he will bring you?&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lots of pretty toys, I guess!</span><br />
And a cloak and pair of mittens,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, perhaps, a pretty dress."</span><br />
<br />
But the little child made answer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a deep, unbidden sigh:</span><br />
"Santa never comes to see me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I never knew just why.</span><br />
<br />
"Nor I don't have pretty playthings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like some other children do;</span><br />
Nor the toys and nuts and candy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That old Santa brings to you.</span><br />
<br />
"For we live down in an alley,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a house that's poor and old;</span><br />
And we scarcely can keep warm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the nights are chill and cold.</span><br />
<br />
"And my mama sews to keep us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So it's all that she can do</span><br />
With the little that she's earning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just to feed and clothe us two.</span><br />
<br />
"So, perhaps, that's why old Santa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never knocks upon our door,</span><br />
'Cause he don't care for the children<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the people who are poor."</span><br />
<br />
To the little child of plenty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas a story strange, but true,</span><br />
That her Santa was so partial,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And would give to such a few.</span><br />
<br />
Home she ran and told her mama<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All the story, strange and sad:</span><br />
"He's a naughty, naughty Santa,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So I'll make the children glad.</span><br />
<br />
"I will just make up some bundles<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the things he brings to me,</span><br />
Then I'll play that I am Santa,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a pretty Christmas tree.</span><br />
<br />
"And I'll go down the alley<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And that little girl I'll find;</span><br />
That will teach him such a lesson!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One, I think, he'll always mind.</span><br />
<br />
"Then I'll write a different letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the ones he's had before;</span><br />
And I'll tell him it's his duty<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just to stop at every door.</span><br />
<br />
"That, I guess, will set him thinking<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All about his conduct here;</span><br />
Then the poor he will remember<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he comes another year."</span><br />
<br />
So out went the little Santa<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the bundles from her tree;</span><br />
And she passed not by a doorway<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where she found that want might be.</span><br />
<br />
And the lesson for old Santa<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In her childish way she taught</span><br />
To the selfish ones about her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who for others had no thought.</span></td></tr></table>

<br />
"But, Robin, you know that the rain might fall,<br />
And the day might end in a dreadful squall;<br />
So I cannot see why you have been so slow,<br />
For the rest have flown there long ago.<br />
<br />
"Say, what do you do in that far sunny clime?<br />
Does Santa Claus come there at Christmas time?<br />
You cannot go coasting, or skating on ice,<br />
So I don't think the South can be very nice."<br />
<br />
"When you are watching for Santa Claus' sleigh,<br />
He travels down South in a far differ'nt way.<br />
In a great air ship, with fairies for guides,<br />
From chimney to chimney he quietly rides.<br />
<br />
"When you are coasting adown some hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span><br />
I'll be drinking from some rippling rill;<br />
When you are freezing your feet on your skates,<br />
I'll be sailing o'er beautiful lakes.<br />
<br />
"When you are making a man out of snow,<br />
I'll be tending some wild-flower show;<br />
When you are trying your best to keep warm,<br />
I'll be away from Jack Frost's harm.<br />
<br />
"But now I am going to say good-by,<br />
So, dear little girl, for me do not cry.<br />
I'll not be afraid though the journey is long,<br />
For my body is warm and my wings are strong.<br />
<br />
"But if I grow tired and think 'twill be best,<br />
I'll stop on the way and take a short rest;<br />
And in the glad spring I'll come flying back,<br />
And others will follow right on in my track.<br />
<br />
"So watch for my coming and list for my song,<br />
For winter is short and you won't wait long";<br />
Then he sang unto me a robin's adieu,<br />
And opened his wings and southward he flew.</td></tr></table>

<span class="smcap">Miss Chrysanth'um</span> gave a party<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On a cool October night,</span><br />
And invited in the flowers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That had tender buds in sight.</span><br />
<br />
Then she whispered to the Pansy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That old Jack was coming soon,</span><br />
And he'd nip her tender budlets<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If she left them out to bloom.</span><br />
<br />
Then she told the grand Nasturtium,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That was climbing up the wall,</span><br />
That if Jack should overtake her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She was sure to have a fall.</span><br />
<br />
And she said to Miss Petunia:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"You must find a hiding-place,</span><br />
For if Jack should chance to kiss you<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He would spoil your pretty face."</span><br />
<br />
And the other summer flowers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That were blooming rather late,</span><br />
She told them all to hide away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or they'd meet a frosty fate.</span><br />
<br />
So they put their heads together,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All the flowers that were wise,</span><br />
And they planned to fool old Jack<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With his sparkling, piercing eyes.</span><br />
<br />
But the flowers that were foolish,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When she bade them take advice,</span><br />
Shook their heads of flowery beauty<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they laughed at frost and ice.</span><br />
<br />
Miss Chrysanth'um helped the wise ones<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the plans that they had laid:</span><br />
So they gathered leaves of maple,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And some coverlets then made.</span><br />
<br />
When old Jack came stealing onward,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the stars all shining bright,</span><br />
Not a flower among the wise ones<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was there left to greet his sight.</span><br />
<br />
All were hidden under covers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Made from leaves of Autumn's gold;</span><br />
And Jack then failed to find them<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though he was so sharp and old.</span><br />
<br />
But the Marigold was laughing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he chanced to pass her by;</span><br />
And Nasturtium still was climbing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er the wall so old and high.</span><br />
<br />
Then he blew his breath upon them<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they both began to sneeze;</span><br />
Soon the tender buds and blossoms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the flowers began to freeze.</span><br />
<br />
When the sun shone out next morning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er the pretty flower-bed,</span><br />
All the wise ones were rejoicing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the foolish ones&mdash;were dead.</span></td></tr></table>

<span class="smcap">As Dot</span> sat by the fire one night,<br />

Of summer days, of romps, and plays,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of school, and its hard task.</span><br />
<br />
She thought of times of misspelled words,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And numbers hard to sum,</span><br />
Of tardy lines, and awful times,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scales she could not run.</span><br />
<br />
So Dot resolved that winter night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The new year she would try</span><br />
To study well, and learn to spell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sing the scale up high.</span><br />
<br />
So when began the winter term,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Dot went off to school,</span><br />
She with the rest then tried her best<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To learn each little rule.</span><br />
<br />
Though little Dot meant all she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Somehow 'twas hard to do;</span><br />
'Twas greater fun to slide or run<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than multiply by two.</span><br />
<br />
The seat grew hard, the teacher cross,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lessons harder got;</span><br />
"I'd rather skate than use my slate,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So mused poor little Dot.</span><br />
<br />
When time wore on to balmy days,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With sunshine and with showers;</span><br />
She stayed away from school, to play<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gather wild-wood flowers.</span><br />
<br />
So when, at last, the school was closed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She dropped behind the class;</span><br />

Her little hands were soft and white,<br />
And so she kept them day and night.<br />

Her dimpled cheeks were pretty too,<br />
In rosy tints of nature's hue.<br />

And oh! such happy times had we,<br />
My little sister Lisle and me.<br />
<br />
We sometimes kept a little store,<br />
And sold our playthings o'er and o'er.<br />
<br />
And through the long, long summer day,<br />
Upon the lawn we used to play.<br />
<br />
We played with dishes and with dolls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span><br />
With dolly cabs and rubber balls.<br />
<br />
She helped to wash the dishes too,<br />
Like little sisters always do.<br />
<br />
And in her sorrows I could share,<br />
For sister was my only care.<br />
<br />
And with a loving sister's arm<br />
I used to shield her from all harm.<br />

Then life for me was all a joy<br />
Before Lisle turned into a boy.<br />

But Time flies on his changing wings,<br />

The creeping worm becomes a fly,<br />
And wings his way toward the sky.<br />
<br />
The golden egg within the nest,<br />
Becomes a chick with downy breast.<br />
<br />
The pollywog becomes a frog,<br />
And croaks within his hidden bog.<br />
<br />
And little sisters turn to boys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span><br />
And leave their dolls for warlike toys<br />
<br />
Then Time brought me the saddest day,<br />
When sister's frocks were laid away.<br />
<br />
The little cloak and bonnet too<br />
Were changed for cap and coat of blue.<br />
<br />
And for the girl with sweetest face&mdash;<br />
A boy had stepped into her place.<br />
<br />
A boy! and oh, so changed is he!<br />
From the little girl he used to be.<br />
<br />
The dimpled feet are brown and bare,<br />
And rough and tumbled is his hair.<br />
<br />
The rosy cheeks of nature's hue&mdash;<br />
Sometimes they're black, sometimes they're blue.<br />
<br />
The little hands so soft and white&mdash;<br />
With dirt begrimed, they are a sight.<br />
<br />
Now through the long, long summer days,<br />
Upon the coalhouse roof he plays.<br />
<br />
And on the roof he sits and fishes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span><br />
And never helps me wash the dishes.<br />
<br />
He scorns the sister's loving arm<br />
That used to shield him from all harm;<br />
<br />
And for my loving, watchful care,<br />
He turns his nose up in the air.<br />
<br />
Oh! I wish he'd never turned into a boy,<br />
To bring such woe instead of joy;<br />
<br />
But stayed a little girl like me,<br />
For then my life would happier be.</td></tr></table>

He always kept near that little home-nest,<br />
And often would sit to give his mate rest.<br />
<br />
When she grew tired of waiting so long,<br />
He would cheer her up with a sweet little song.<br />
In a very short time her sitting was o'er,<br />
And the birds in her nest numbered just four.<br />
<br />
A sweet little girl lived near to this tree,<br />
Who was happy as ever a girl could be;<br />
She had a nice doll, that had a nice swing,<br />
That had hung in this tree since early in spring.<br />
<br />
One day she was swinging her doll to and fro,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span><br />
Mother Robin was peeking at her below;<br />
She said: "Little girl, little girl, look up to me,<br />
I've four little birdies for you to see."<br />
<br />
"O Mother Robin, I'm glad they have come!<br />
I'll go right now and bring you a crumb;<br />
I'll bring one for your mate and each of the four,<br />
And when supper is ready I'll bring you some more."<br />
<br />
"All right, little girl, I wish that you would,<br />
I'm glad to see you so thoughtful and good;<br />
But I wish you would keep old Tabby away,<br />
For I know she was gazing up here to-day."<br />
<br />
"O Mother Robin, you must have no alarm!<br />
For Tabby, I'm sure, will do you no harm;<br />
She's a good old cat and minds what I say,<br />
But I'll tell her again not to come this way.<br />
<br />
"Will you give me a birdie? one of your four,<br />
I only want one and not any more;<br />
I have a nice cage I could hang in the tree,<br />
And birdie, I know, would be happy with me."<br />
<br />
"Oh, no; little girl, it never will do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span><br />
To part with my birdie and give her to you;<br />
She never could live shut up in a cage,<br />
And my mate, I fear, would fly in a rage.<br />
<br />
"Will you give me your doll? I'd like to have one<br />
For my little birdies, you know they have none;<br />
When they get older they'll all want to play,<br />
And I've room by my nest to tuck her away."<br />
<br />
"Oh, no; Mother Robin, my dolly would cry,<br />
If she lived in a nest that was up so high;<br />
When the wind blew my dolly would fall,<br />
Then down would come birdies, nest, and all.<br />
<br />
"So I'll keep my dolly, for I think it is best,<br />
And you keep your birds till they fly from the nest;<br />
They will be happier, I know, to be free,<br />
And my dolly's contented to stay here with me."</td></tr></table>

<span class="smcap">When</span> Santa came one wintry night,<br />
A pair of stockings hung in sight<br />
<br />
Just side by side upon the wall&mdash;<br />
But one was large and one was small.<br />
<br />
When Santa turned and saw them there,<br />
He said: "Well, that's a queer-matched pair!<br />
<br />
"This girl is up to tricks I see,<br />
And thinks she'll play a joke on me;<br />
<br />
"But I'll look 'round and soon find out<br />
What this fair miss has been about."<br />
<br />
And then he took the stockings down,<br />
And a folded note in one he found.<br />
<br />
'Twas written plain, so Santa read<br />
Each line and word the wee note said:<br />
<br />
"Dear, dear Santa, I hope you won't mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span><br />
Because two stockings you happen to find.<br />
<br />
"Don't think I'm greedy, that won't be fair!<br />
For one is grandma's you see hung there.<br />
<br />
"You have not filled it since she was young,<br />
So I hung it up to have some fun.<br />
<br />
"So please, dear Santa, do not scold,<br />
For grandma now is getting old.<br />
<br />
"She wants some specs, so she can see<br />
To knit some winter mitts for me.<br />
<br />
"Then 'twould be nice if you've enough<br />
So you could spare a box of snuff.<br />
<br />
"Some gum to chew, some nuts to crack&mdash;<br />
I'm sure you've got them in your pack.<br />
<br />
"She needs a cap with lace and strings,<br />
So, Santa, please give her these things.<br />

"That's all I'll ask; if you'll do this,<br />
I'll pay you some time with a kiss."<br />

"This little girl, with heart of gold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span><br />
Must love her grandma now so old.<br />
<br />
"And it's all for fun! Yes, yes, I see!"<br />
Then Santa laughed again with glee.<br />
<br />
"I'll carry the joke as far as I can,<br />
For I like some fun, if I am an old man."<br />
<br />
Then dropping his pack upon the floor,<br />
He looked its contents o'er and o'er,<br />
<br />
And found a cap, some specs, and gum,<br />
A whistle, doll, and little drum;<br />
<br />
A nice red sled, and doll buggy, too,<br />
Old Santa found as he searched them through.<br />
<br />
Into grandma's stocking he stuffed the doll;<br />
Although 'twas large, it wouldn't hold all.<br />
<br />
Then tied with a string the sticks and drum,<br />
And said: "Now grandma can have some fun."<br />
<br />
Then into the other, the one so small,<br />
He stuffed the cap, specs, snuff, and all.<br />
<br />
Then said to himself, the jolly old man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span><br />
"I've carried the joke as far as I can.<br />
<br />
"I'd better be off ere grandma is waking,<br />
Or maybe I'll get a jolly good shaking."<br />
<br />
Then should'ring his pack till his form was bent,<br />
He got into mischief wherever he went.<br />
<br />
Then in the morning, when grandma awoke,<br />
She laughed, till she cried, at Santa's queer joke.</td></tr></table>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like the bad boys do,</span><br />
By pulling her tail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till it's nearly in two;</span><br />
Then whistles and laughs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he hears her mew.</span><br />
<br />
If I had my wish,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do you know what I'd say?</span><br />
I'd tell my poor mama<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To give him away</span><br />
To grandpa and grandma,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there make him stay.</span><br />
<br />
But, then, poor grandpa!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He never could nap</span><br />
Without a bad boy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crawling up on his lap,</span><br />
And whipping his knees<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To make them get-ap.</span><br />
<br />
And poor, dear grandma,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So patient and kind,</span><br />
It worries her so<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because he won't mind;</span><br />
And then her glasses<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She never could find.</span><br />
<br />
I suppose I must live,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And try, if I can,</span><br />
To bear with his capers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until he's a man;</span><br />
<br />
But I do hope then<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My brother will see</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'd like to have you know;</span><br />
So, now, I'm going to tell it:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My sister has a beau.</span><br />
<br />
She looks so sweet and pretty<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Tommy comes to call;</span><br />
And talks so nice and witty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And is so good to all.</span><br />
<br />
I'm afraid he's going to love her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And marry her some day;</span><br />
But if he only knew her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He'd think another way.</span><br />
<br />
She's awful cross to brother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Tommy ain't around;</span><br />
I don't believe a crosser girl<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Could anywhere be found.</span><br />
<br />
She says I am a bother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When she has got a beau;</span><br />
And act so very stupid<br />

I only told to Tommy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That she would lie in bed,</span><br />
And let our tired mama<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do all the work instead.</span><br />
<br />
I told him not to love her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For she was awful cross;</span><br />
And me and little brother<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She always tried to "boss."</span><br />
<br />
I guess he's going to listen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And my advice he'll take.</span><br />
He said she must do better<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or she would get the shake.</span><br />
<br />
I'm just a-going to tell her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To mind what she's about;</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Old</span> Biddy Brown, a nice old hen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Belonged to little Nell;</span><br />
She hid her nest from all the rest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And kept her secret well.</span><br />
<br />
And every morn, just like the sun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She made her daily trip</span><br />
Up in the hay her egg to lay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gave the rest the slip</span><br />
<br />
But one cold day old Biddy Brown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Concluded it was best,</span><br />
That in the hay she'd better stay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And take a little rest.</span><br />
<br />
They missed her from the chicken coop,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And from the barnyard pen;</span><br />
And none could tell, not even Nell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just where to find that hen.</span><br />
<br />
The days went by, the weeks sped on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And still she hid away;</span><br />
But little Nell kept hunting well,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And found her in the hay.</span><br />
<br />
Now, Easter time was drawing nigh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Nell, in colors bright,</span><br />
Was going to taint, with brush and paint,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Old Biddy's eggs so white.</span><br />
<br />
She took them from the poor old hen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who'd sat so long with care,</span><br />
And in a tin she brought them in,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which really was not fair.</span><br />
<br />
She dabbled with those pretty paints,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till shells were lost to view;</span><br />
Then with delight she viewed the sight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of eggs, in red and blue.</span><br />
<br />
She put them by the kitchen stove,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And covered them up tight,</span><br />
To keep them warm and free from harm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And out of baby's sight.</span><br />
<br />
The next morn rang the Easter bells,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Nell rose with a start;</span><br />
Her playmates, some would surely come<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To view her work of art.</span><br />
<br />
So proudly to the kitchen then,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With step so light and free,</span><br />
With happy look her playmates took,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those Easter eggs to see.</span><br />
<br />
But what a change came over Nell!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had some one played her tricks?</span><br />
To her surprise, before her eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was a pan of downy chicks.</span></td></tr></table>

<span class="smcap">My doll</span> got sick one summer day,<br />
And then I had to stop my play.<br />
<br />
I tucked her in her little bed,<br />
With burning cheeks and throbbing head.<br />
<br />
I knew that she was cutting teeth,<br />
And that one thought gave me relief.<br />
<br />
But still I wondered as I had,<br />
Why her poor head should ache so bad.<br />
<br />
She seemed so ill for one so young,<br />
So I thought I'd have the doctor come.<br />
<br />
I sent for him to come&mdash;come quick,<br />
For my dear Nell was very sick.<br />
<br />
Then when he came he shook his head,<br />
And this is what the doctor said:<br />
<br />
"She has the measles or some fever;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span><br />
But have no fear, I can relieve her.<br />
<br />
"I'll give her powders for her head,<br />
But you must keep her close in bed.<br />
<br />
"I'll give her quinine made in pills,<br />
And they will cure those dreadful chills.<br />
<br />
"But when your neighbors come to call,<br />
Don't let them see your babe at all.<br />
<br />
"She must not talk, nor even smile;<br />
So keep her quiet for a while.<br />
<br />
"Be careful what you give to eat,<br />
Now don't give salads or cold meat.<br />
<br />
"Nor don't give biscuits that are warm,<br />
For they will do your dolly harm.<br />
<br />
"But give her nicely buttered toast,<br />
With veal, or lamb, or mutton roast."<br />
<br />
I watched beside her suffering bed,<br />
And many were the tears I shed.<br />
<br />
But soon a change came o'er my Nell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span><br />
I saw that she was getting well.<br />
<br />
Oh, what a joy it was to me,<br />
To know from pain my Nell was free!<br />
<br />
But she was very pale and thin,<br />
With faded cheeks and pointed chin.<br />
<br />
Then came the doctor with his bills&mdash;<br />
So much for powders, so much for pills.<br />
<br />
I paid them all without a sigh,<br />
And thanked him 'cause she did not die.</td></tr></table>

"For I must send it to some friend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who loves me very well."</span><br />
<br />
She thought of cousin Madaline,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A proud and haughty miss,</span><br />
But changed her mind almost as soon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For she would scoff at this.</span><br />
<br />
She thought of neighbor Bessie Brown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But she was rich and fair,</span><br />
And every year her valentines<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were more than one girl's share.</span><br />
<br />
And next she thought of classmates dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then said their names all o'er;</span><br />
But every year their valentines<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would number more and more.</span><br />
<br />
So who should get her valentine?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She thought and thought in vain;</span><br />
At last she said: "I'll keep this one,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And none shall have the gain."</span><br />
<br />
Just then a little voice was heard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To whisper in her ear:</span><br />
"There's many a girl and many a boy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who will get none this year.</span><br />
<br />
"So, Clarabel, please think again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of some poor children's plight,</span><br />
Who never get a valentine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To make their sad hearts light."</span><br />
<br />
She heard that voice, and then she thought:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I know what I shall do,</span><br />
And where to send this valentine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And many others, too."</span><br />
<br />
She took her little money bank,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where she had kept her dimes,</span><br />
Then swiftly to the store she ran,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bought more valentines.</span><br />
<br />
She sent them to the boys and girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose pleasures were but few;</span><br />
Then told her playmates what she'd done,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then they tried it, too.</span><br />
<br />
So many were the valentines<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That went their happy way,</span><br />
And many were the girls and boys<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That had a happy day.</span><br />
<br />
They thanked the postman o'er and o'er,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those hapless little elves,</span><br />
Because he brought them valentines<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For their own little selves.</span><br />
<br />
And Clarabel was happy too,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And truly did believe</span><br />

When all were through at dinner time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There naught remained but crumbs;</span><br />
For pretty Flo and her young beau,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ate all the sugar plums.</span><br />
Then grandma smiled when she looked round<br />

<span class="smcap">My mama</span> says that I'm too old<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To play with dolls much more,</span><br />
That I must lay them all away<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For dolly days for me are o'er.</span><br />
<br />
But what I'll do, I do not know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When they're all laid away;</span><br />
I know I'll sigh and maybe cry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I've no doll with me to play.</span><br />
<br />
Then with them all put out of sight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The days will lonely be;</span><br />
For when I'm mad, or when I'm sad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There'll be no doll to comfort me.</span><br />
<br />
There's Maggie May, my eldest one,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The doll that was so fine,</span><br />
Santa let her drop from the chimney top,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And caused a crooked spine.</span><br />
<br />
She's been a cripple ever since,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And such a fretful child,</span><br />
She's cried and screamed until it seemed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I really should go wild.</span><br />
<br />
There's sweet Marie, a pretty doll,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With hair of golden hue,</span><br />
With cheeks so bright and chin so white,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And eyes of heaven's blue.</span><br />
<br />
And Rosa Nell, another blond,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose temper is so mild,</span><br />
That every one, both old and young,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Could love the pretty child.</span><br />
<br />
She's broke her nose, but what of that!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She always wears a smile,</span><br />
She's at her play the livelong day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sings most all the while.</span><br />
<br />
There's Lilla Dale, with tangled hair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who's lain so long in bed,</span><br />
When very small she had a fall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That cracked her little head.</span><br />
<br />
She'll miss my care and I'll miss her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When she is laid away;</span><br />
For many a time I've soothed her whine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because she could not play.</span><br />
<br />
And Nellie Gray, the sweet brunette,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose hair was dark as night,</span><br />
My heart will ache and maybe break,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When she's laid out of sight.</span><br />
<br />
She's lost an arm and both her legs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And only has one curl;</span><br />
But you may bet she's precious yet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This dear old darky girl.</span><br />
<br />
But now I'm old; too old, they say,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've entered in my teens;</span><br />
But I'll look back o'er memory's track,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To happy doll-day dreams.</span><br />
<br />
There'll be no hours in years to come,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That have been like the past;</span><br />

Unto the world they seemed to say:<br />
"This is our little children's day.<br />
<br />
"Now will you listen to our call,<br />
And come to hear the children small?<br />
<br />
"Their songs in voices, sweet and clear,<br />
Unto their Maker you shall hear.<br />

"Their smiling faces are a sight,<br />
That turns all darkness into light.<br />

"Their little speeches are so nice,<br />

"Their prayers so humble, sweet, and pure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span><br />

Went to the Maker up above;<br />

<span class="smcap">I often</span> sit and wonder why<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is not always day,</span><br />
And why the sunshine and the light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cannot forever stay.</span><br />
<br />
I often sit and wonder why<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The birdies are so wild,</span><br />
And what does make them fly away<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From every little child.</span><br />
<br />
And why they always like to sing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never like us talk,</span><br />
And why they always like to fly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never like us walk.</span><br />
<br />
Sometimes I sit and wonder too,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">About my pussy cats,</span><br />
Just why they did not have some wings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like ugly little bats.</span><br />
<br />
My dolly is a mystery too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span><br />

When I am washing dolly's face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She does not pout and cry.</span><br />
<br />
And then it never seemed quite right<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To have the world turn round;</span><br />
It seems so strange we do not fall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or tumble off the ground.</span><br />
<br />
There are so many other things<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That don't look right to me;</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Now</span> what's the use of wondering<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why 'tis not always day?</span><br />
For we must have the night to sleep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So we can rest from play.</span><br />
<br />
And there's the little birdies too,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It's all right they are wild;</span><br />
For it never was intended<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They should play with a child.</span><br />
<br />
I'd rather hear them singing sweet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than hear them try to talk;</span><br />
And rather see them flying high<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than see them try to walk.</span><br />
<br />
Then what would be the use of wings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon a pussy cat?</span><br />
Because she could not catch a mouse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When flying like a bat.</span><br />
<br />
Then what good could a dolly do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To cry, or fret, or scream,</span><br />
Because her mama's gentle hand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was trying to wash her clean.</span><br />
<br />
And then I think it is all right<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because the world turns round;</span><br />
For gravitation in the earth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Does keep us on the ground.</span><br />
<br />
So then, to me, this world of ours<br />

"For I can tend the baby,<br />

<br />
Then mama kissed her daughter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And said a fond good-by;</span><br />
But gently did remind her:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Don't let the baby cry,</span><br />
Don't burn the dinner pudding,<br />

She went to stir the pudding,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But baby began to cry;</span><br />
She had to stop and rock her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sing a lullaby;</span><br />
But could not get her quiet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No matter how she'd try.</span><br />
<br />
She called for helpful brother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thought he was around;</span><br />
But no response was given,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not one familiar sound;</span><br />
For little helpful brother<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was nowhere to be found.</span><br />

The noon hour was approaching,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span><br />

When papa came at noon-time,<br />

When mama came at evening<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All draped in woven lace;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Reflects a handsome face.</span><br />
<br />
"I've pictures on the mantelshelf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I purchased just of late;</span><br />
The frames are fine and nicely shine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all are up to date."</span><br />
<br />
The fly then crossed the threshold line<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never thought of harm;</span><br />
The spider wise then blinked his eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And spun a little yarn.</span><br />
<br />
He said unto his victim fair:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"This is a pretty place;</span><br />
So won't you fly to the window high<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where hangs the woven lace?"</span><br />
<br />
The fly flew to the window pane<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where spider lace was hung;</span><br />
And ere he knew just what to do<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A web was 'round him strung.</span><br />
<br />
He buzzed and hummed and fluttered there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And struggled with his might.</span><br />
The spider sly had caught the fly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And held him very tight.</span><br />
<br />
So let's not listen, like the fly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To untrue tales that are told;</span><br />
For we must mind we're sure to find<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All glittering things aren't gold.</span><br />
<br />
Let's not be led to danger then<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By a sinful, harmful guide;</span><br />
But walk each day in the narrow way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shun the one that's wide.</span></td></tr></table>

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But of little Tom Green,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The boy who was mean,</span><br />
She said she would surely leave out;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And would only invite</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The boy who did right,</span><br />
And he was that little John Trout.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To the piper's son Tom,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She said: "Come along</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then poor simple Simon,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who met the fat pieman,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A change in her life,</span><br />
And let her come out of her shell.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But poor Humpty-Dumpty!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He got such a bumpty,</span><br />
When he fell way down from the wall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That he went all to smash</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With a terrible crash,</span><br />
So she couldn't invite him at all.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then old Mother Goose</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thought 'twould be of no use</span><br />
To invite the king and the queen;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For they lived so high</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On their blackbird pie,</span><br />
And with poor folks wouldn't be seen.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But thought 'twould be right</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To kindly invite</span><br />
The woman who lived in the shoe.<br />

In bringing the children there too.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So all the folks came</span><br />

They're better far than all the gum<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That's chewed upon the street.</span><br />

This is the time I like so well<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wish 'twere always here.</span><br />
Of all the months that call around<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I think March sweetest of the year.</span></td></tr></table>

<span class="smcap">The</span> welcome month of April,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With sunshine and with showers,</span><br />
Sets all the buds to swelling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And brings the early flowers.</span><br />
<br />
And nature now has wakened<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From her long and wintry sleep,</span><br />
And dandelions are peeping<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the grasses at our feet.</span><br />
<br />
The bullfrog loud is calling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the pond or running stream,</span><br />
And the nesting birds are cooing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In their early "love's young dream."</span><br />
<br />
The hop-toad in the cellar<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thinks he'll take a look without,</span><br />
And old shanghi on the fence<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crows and flops his wings about.</span><br />
<br />
And I am just as happy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the butterfly or bee,</span><br />
For the showery month of April<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is a welcome month to me.</span></td></tr></table>

<span class="smcap">The</span> sweetest time of all the year<br />
Is when the month of May draws near.<br />
The air is sweet with rich perfume<br />
That comes from apple-trees in bloom.<br />
<br />
The peach-tree sheds its fragrance too,<br />
And sips alike its share of dew.<br />
The lilac blooms and shows its right<br />
To make this month a flowery sight.<br />
<br />
The pansy lifts her welcome face<br />
From out her long-leaved hiding-place.<br />
The violet blossoms as of old<br />
And shows her color true as gold.<br />
<br />
The brooks they ripple as they go<br />
From brink to brink, in ceaseless flow.<br />
The lark sails high on upward wing&mdash;<br />
All Nature's glad to greet the spring.<br />
<br />
The wild flowers blossom in the wood,<br />
And all proclaim that God is good.<br />
Of all the months I'd have to stay<br />
It is the flowery month of May.</td></tr></table>

<span class="smcap">The</span> month of June brings roses sweet,<br />
And daisies blooming at our feet;<br />
When Nature sings her sweetest tune,<br />
'Tis in the balmy month of June.<br />
<br />
And glad vacation June will bring,<br />
Then old school bells will cease to ring,<br />
But wedding bells their sweet refrain<br />
Will ring and ring out just the same.<br />
<br />
Now lilies white upon the stream,<br />
In early morning will be seen;<br />
And cherries ripe upon the tree<br />
Are tempting to the birds and me.<br />
<br />
So robin hops from limb to limb,<br />
And seems to think they're all for him;<br />
And gets his share, and even more,<br />
Before the cherry time is o'er.<br />
<br />
This is the month that suits me best,<br />
And I love it better than all the rest;<br />
I'd always sing the same gay tune,<br />
If all the months were just like June.</td></tr></table>
